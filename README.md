## Keep My Notes

Keep My Notes is a user-friendly and efficient Jetpack Compose application designed to help you manage and organize your notes with ease. With Keep My Notes, you can access your notes from anywhere, at any time. Our application boasts a range of features to enhance your note-taking experience:

## Features:

### Clean MVVM Architecture - 

Our application is built using the Model-View-ViewModel architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and enhancing the maintainability and scalability of the app.

### Secure Single-Login Feature - 

We prioritize your security and convenience. With a toggleable single-login feature, you can log out from all other devices with just one tap, ensuring that your notes remain private and secure.

### Google Sign-In Integration -

For a seamless login experience, Keep My Notes utilizes Google's credential manager for sign-in purposes. Access your notes quickly and securely with your Google account.

### Kotlin Serialization - 

We've chosen Kotlin serialization over third-party JSON converters. This decision not only improves performance but also ensures better compatibility and type safety within our Kotlin-based application.

### Local and Cloud Database Sync - 

Keep My Notes uses Room Db as its local database, providing offline access to your notes. We've also integrated Firebase Realtime Database to synchronize your notes with our server, so you can rest assured that your notes are safe and accessible across all your devices.
